A focused patent strategy balances cost, scope, and speed. Companies must decide where to file geographically, how broad claims should be, and when to rely on trade secrets instead.

## Strategic Considerations

- Freedom-to-operate analyses
- Patent portfolio vs. defensive filings
- Licensing and monetization

Align patent activity with business objectives for maximum impact.
